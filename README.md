# Spotify-Hits-Prediction-and-Classification

Music streaming services are having a hard time predicting hit songs due to the large number of songs being released every week. This makes it difficult for artists to get paid fairly for their work and for music labels to allocate resources efficiently.

The Spotify Hits Predictor dataset is a machine learning dataset that can be used to predict hit songs. The dataset includes a variety of features that capture the different aspects of a song's arrangement, such as instrumentalness, valence, danceability, and energy. The dataset also includes a target variable that indicates whether a song was a hit or a flop.

This dataset can be used to help music streaming services, artists, and music labels make better decisions about which songs to promote and how to allocate resources.
